					<p>Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain who live 2,000 years ago.</p>
					<p>November 1st marked the end of summer and the harvest as well as the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human death.</p>
					<p>On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.</p>

				<div class="text">
					<p>To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities.</p>
					<p>During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other’s fortunes.</p> 
					<p>When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier that evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.</p>

					<p>Even by 43 A.D. the tradition held strong, but once the Romans conquered the Celtics, the Roman tradition and the Celtic traditions were combined to create a new Halloween.</p>
					<p>The first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans traditionally commemorated the passing of the dead. The second was a day to honor Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees.</p> 
					<p>In 1000 A.D. the catholic church also accepted the tradition and held November 2nd as the All Souls' Day to honor the dead. It is widely believed today that the church was attempting to replace the Celtic festival of the dead with a related, but church-sanctioned holiday.</p>

				<div class="text">
					<p>The first American Halloween celebrations included “play parties,” public events held to celebrate the harvest, where neighbors would share stories of the dead, tell each other’s fortunes, dance and sing. </p>
					<p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, America was flooded with new immigrants. These new immigrants, especially the millions of Irish fleeing Ireland’s potato famine of 1846, helped to popularize the celebration of Halloween nationally. </p> 
					<p>Taking from Irish and English traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition.</p>

				<div class="text">
					<p>In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft.</p>
					<p>At the turn of the century, Halloween parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. Parties focused on games, foods of the season and festive costumes.</p> 
					<p>Parents were encouraged by newspapers and community leaders to take anything “frightening” or “grotesque” out of Halloween celebrations. Because of these efforts, Halloween lost most of its superstitious and religious overtones by the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

					<p>By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular, but community-centered holiday, with parades and town-wide parties as the featured entertainment. </p>
					<p>Despite the best efforts of many schools and communities, vandalism began to plague Halloween celebrations in many communities during this time. </p> 
					<p>By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism and Halloween had evolved into a holiday directed mainly at the young. Due to the high numbers of young children during the fifties baby boom, parties moved from town civic centers into the classroom or home, where they could be more easily accommodated.</p>

				<div class="text">
					<p>The tradition of dressing in costume for Halloween has both European and Celtic roots. On Halloween, when it was believed that ghosts came back to the earthly world, people thought that they would encounter ghosts if they left their homes. </p> 
					<p>To avoid being recognized by these ghosts, people would wear masks when they left their homes after dark so that the ghosts would mistake them for fellow spirits. </p>
					<p>On Halloween, to keep ghosts away from their houses, people would place bowls of food outside their homes to appease the ghosts and prevent them from attempting to enter.</p>

				<div class="text">
					<p>We avoid crossing paths with black cats, afraid that they might bring us bad luck. This idea has its roots in the Middle Ages, when many people believed that witches avoided detection by turning themselves into cats. </p>
					<p>We try not to walk under ladders for the same reason. This superstition may have come from the ancient Egyptians, who believed that triangles were sacred.</p> 
					<p> And around Halloween, especially, we try to avoid breaking mirrors, stepping on cracks in the road or spilling salt.</p>
